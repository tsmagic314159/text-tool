```At first, we have some files as `TestEditor.java`,`PDF.java`, `Functions.java`.<br>
`TestEditor.java` is our main function. During this file, we had written `Open`,`Save`,`Search`,`Confirm`,`Next`,`Select`,`Cut`,`Copy`,`Paste`,`Date`,`Aboutus`,Print functions.We implement these functions by some listeners. 
```
For example, when you run our program `TestEditor.java`, it wil appear a real test editor. On the top of the test editor, there is a menu, we use some JMenu and JButton to wrote it. We have `File`,`Search`,`Date`,`SCPC`,`About`. And if you click them, they will have some items. We use JMenuItem to wrote them. 

### File
If you click this item, you can see `new`,`open`,`save`,`print`,`Save as PDF`. For example, you can start a new test by `new`, open a file in test editor by `open`, save the content of test by `save`,and print it by `print`. If you want save the file as a .pdf, you can click `Save as PDF`.

### Search
In this item, you can write a key word and the test editor can return all the key words in this test.
