At first, we have some files as `TestEditor.java`,`PDF.java`, `Functions.java`.<br>
`TestEditor.java` is our main function. During this file, we had written `Open`,`Save`,`Search`,`Confirm`,`Next`,`Select`,`Cut`,`Copy`,`Paste`,`Date`,`Aboutus`,Print functions.We implement these functions by some listeners. 
For example, when you run our program `TestEditor.java`, it wil appear a real test editor. On the top of the test editor, there is a menu, we use some JMenu and JButton to wrote it. We have `File`,`Search`,`Date`,`SCPC`,`About`. And if you click them, they will have some items. We use JMenuItem to wrote them. 

### File
If you click this item, you can see `new`,`open`,`save`,`print`,`Save as PDF`.
