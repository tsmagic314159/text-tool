### TestEditor.java
For example, when you run our program `TestEditor.java`, it wil appear a real text editor. On the top of the text editor, there is a menu, we use some JMenu and JButton to wrote it. We have `File`,`Search`,`Date`,`SCPC`,`About`. And if you click them, they will have some items. We use JMenuItem to wrote them. 
#### File

If you click this item, you can see `new`,`open`,`save`,`print`,`Save as PDF`. For example, you can start a new test by `new`, open a file in text editor by `open`(If it is a odt file, we will transform it to a pdf file at first. And then we open it by pdf.), save the content of test by `save`,and print it by `print`. If you want save the file as a `.pdf`, you can click `Save as PDF`.
